# Mark a build as "approved": Sign it and copy it to the upload staging
# area.  This should be done after carefully examining the output of the
# recently complete "init" or "diff" run.  Note that once a build has
# been approved, it is rather difficult to "unapprove" it, even if nothing
# has yet been uploaded.
