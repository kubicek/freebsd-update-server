# FreeBSD Update build subroutines.
#
# All the actual work gets done by functions defined here
# and optionally overridden by release-specific and/or
# release-and-platform-specific functions.
#
# Sourcing this is the first thing which scripts do.

### Initialization

# Read global configuration and set global variables.  Run from
# readconfig(), so most scripts don't need to call this directly.
readglobalconfig () {
	# Set paths
	export SCRIPTDIR="`dirname $0`"
	export BASEDIR="`realpath ${SCRIPTDIR}/..`"
	export BINDIR=${BASEDIR}/bin
	export SRCDIR=${BASEDIR}/src
	export KEYDIR=${BASEDIR}/keys
	export PRIVKEYDIR=${KEYDIR}/mnt

	. ${SCRIPTDIR}/build.conf
}

# Read configuration and subroutine override files for FreeBSD/$1 $2.
readconfig () {
	# Make sure we have a target platform specified
	export TARGET=$1
	if [ -z "${TARGET}" ]; then
		echo "Target platform must be set"
		exit 1
	fi

	# Make sure we have a release specified
	export REL=$2
	if [ -z "${REL}" ]; then
		echo "Release name must be set"
		exit 1
	fi

	# Get global configuration and variables.
	readglobalconfig

	# Set paths
	export PATCHDIR=${BASEDIR}/patches/${REL}
	export WORKDIR=${BASEDIR}/work/${REL}/${TARGET}
	export PUBDIR=${BASEDIR}/pub/${REL}/${TARGET}
	export STAGEDIR=${WORKDIR}/stage
	export TMPDIR=${WORKDIR}/tmp

	# Default TARGET_ARCH is TARGET.  On pc98, this needs to be
	# overridden in the platform-specific configuration.
	export TARGET_ARCH=${TARGET}

	# RELP is REL, unless it is changed to be REL-pX instead.
	export RELP=${REL}

	# Make sure the target/release pair make sense.
	if ! [ -f ${SCRIPTDIR}/${REL}/${TARGET}/build.conf ]; then
		echo "No configuration available for FreeBSD/${TARGET} ${REL}"
		exit 1

### Utility subroutines

# Logging function

# Nuke a world and delete its associated index.

	umount ${KEYDEV}

	# Overwrite the memory disk with random garbage before deleting it.
	# This may prevent the key from lingering in memory; in particular,
	# overwriting with zeros often won't, due to overly intelligent
	# memory disk code.
	dd if=/dev/urandom of=${KEYDEV} count=2048 2>/dev/null
	mdconfig -d -u `echo ${KEYDEV} | cut -c 8-`
}

# Generate RSA key

			release before running diff.sh.
