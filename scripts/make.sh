# Build binaries used by FreeBSD Update builds and generate an RSA signing
# key.  The SHA256 hash of the public key is printed and must be distributed
# to clients in a secure manner.

# NOTE: This script must be run before anything else (even init.sh), and
# MUST ONLY BE RUN ONCE.  Running this script again will overwrite your
# signing key.
