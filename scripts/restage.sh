# Re-stage a previously staged build.  This is useful if, after running
# diff.sh, you notice that some files were identified as "modified" which
# really weren't modified; you can then edit the built release and run
# this script to re-stage it.  That said, this should be done with extreme
# caution, since manually editing builds in this manner can easily result
# in security patches being omitted.
